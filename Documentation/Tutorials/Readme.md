# Tutorials

The tutorials explain how to use MARVELO in 3 different environments

## 1. Localhost environment - Single node

MARVELO is running on **one hosting machine**, where **only one node** is available in the network. I.e., one node will be **running all the processing modules/blocks**. The IP of this node is your localhost: 127.0.0.1

* [Hello World](Example1.md)

* [Send a value between 2 modules](Example2.md)
* [Send an array between 2 modules](Example3.md)

## 2. Localhost environment - Multiple nodes 

###### [ToDo]

MARVELO is running on **one hosting machine**, where **virtual multiple nodes are available in the network**. I.e., **multiple nodes will be running all the processing modules/blocks**. 

- create virtual nodes
- Hello World

- Send a value between 2 modules
- Send an array between 2 modules

## 3. Ad hoc Environment

###### [ToDo] 

MARVELO is running on top of **wireless ad hoc network**, where **multiple physical nodes are available in the network**. I.e., **multiple nodes will be running all the processing modules/blocks**. 

- Check network connectivity
- Hello World

- Send a value between 2 modules
- Send an array between 2 modules
